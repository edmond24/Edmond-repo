The project is about a Functional Medicine Wellness clinic whice provides the most convenient and holistic approach to address the root cause of symptoms or diseases as compared to basic symptom management often found in conventional medicine. Functional Medicine involves a series of testing to find the root cause of diseases instead of treating just symptions. This clinic do high level testing than the routine annual physical offered by primary care doctors. 

Unlike a routine physical exam which only occurs annually, functional Medicine testing requires a patient to test twice yearly. Not all the patients show up for their second round of testing after six months so the clinic usually have to track them down for retesting. Most of the time, they're able to get some patients in for retesting.The clinic now wants to predict the type of patients that are more likely to come back for restesting without them having to track them now.

This is predictive analysis so it falls under logistic regression and will be predicting some continuous number because the data will be measureable and can take on infinitive values. The succesful completion of this preditive analysis will be beneficial to the clinic because they will know exactly the patients who are more likely to return for retesting without having to track them down. This will cut the overhead cost of making hiring an administrative personell to make all those phone calls to patients to convince them to return for retest. The values to be used as predictors will have the most impact in predicting who these patients who are most likely to return.

The dataset to be used for this predictive analysis is coming from the clinic. The dataset contains all the clinc's patients.
